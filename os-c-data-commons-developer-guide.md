# OS-Climate Data Commons Developer Guide

This developer guide is for data engineers, data scientists and developers of the OS-Climate community who are looking at leveraging the OS-Climate Data Commons to build data ingestion and processing pipelines, as well as AI / ML pipelines. It shows step-by-step how to configure your development environment, structure projects, and manage data and code in a way that complies with our Architecture Blueprint.

## GitOps for reproducibility, portability, traceability with AI support

Nowadays, developers (including data scientists) use Git and GitOps practices to store and share code on development platforms such as GitHub. GitOps best practices allow for reproducibility and traceability in projects. For this reason, we have decided to adopt a GitOps approach toward managing the platform, data pipeline code as well as data and related artifacts.

One of the most important requirements to ensure data quality through reproducibility is dependency management. Having dependencies clearly managed in audited configuration artifacts allows portability of notebooks, so they can be shared safely with others and reused in other projects.

## Project templates

We use two project templates as starting point for new repositories:

- A project template for data pipelines, specific to OS-Climate Data Commons, can be found here: [Data Pipelines Template][16]
- A project tempalte specifically for AI/ML pipelines can be found here: [Data Science Template][1].

Together the use of these templates ties data scientist needs (e.g. notebooks, models) and data engineers needs (e.g. data and metadata pipelines). Having structure in a project ensures all the pieces required for the Data and MLOps lifecycles are present and easily discoverable.
